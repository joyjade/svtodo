# Svelte To Do App

Following allong with MDN's Svelte [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started). Under the hood is Svelte + Vite. 

## Big learnings

- Wrap my head around reactive statements `$: babies` and assigning values as triggering rerenders across the framework
- Passing event handlers as props to children, and children being able to update parent state by triggering those events
- `bind:[things]`
- expressive functions in `const` as events that are called `on:events`

## Trying to get to

- Local storage
